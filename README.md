# Sklearn_Session

In this notebook, we explore the basics of the sklearn library and delve into preprocessing and modeling techniques.
We did the Preprocessing on our regression data and the modelling on both to show the difference.
We encountered common issues during the modeling phase, such as poor performance in regression and overfitting in classification models.
Through practical examples and discussions, we aim to understand the root causes behind these problems and learn how to address them effectively.
Stay tuned for insightful discussions and solutions!
