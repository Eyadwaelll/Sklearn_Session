## Details

- We begin by conducting **preprocessing** tasks on our regression data, ensuring it's prepared for modeling.
- Next, we delve into **modeling**, showcasing techniques for both regression and classification tasks.
- During our exploration, we encountered common challenges such as poor performance in regression and overfitting in classification models.
- Through practical examples and discussions, we aim to dissect these issues, uncovering their root causes, and providing effective solutions.
